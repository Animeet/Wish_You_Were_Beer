# **Wish You Were Beer**


## **Description**

This application has two working API's.

**The first API is Google Places:**

**The second API is The Cocktail DB:**
> A database filled with hundreds of different cocktails that populate randomly when clicking the 'Randomized Cocktail' button.

## **Usage**

If you've ever found yourself wondering what local bars might be in your area, debated on bar hopping but don't know where to, or have trouble finding/thinking of new cocktails to try, then Wish You Were Beer is the web app to be on.
Whether you are preparing for your night out, or already out in town, you can use this web app to target local bars closeby to you (Assuming you know the zip code).
Maybe you are at a bar, and really just want to try something different. Our randomized cocktail button will throw up hundreds of different options for you to test your bartender with.

Either way, within just a couple of minutes you can have a planned night out with ease.
Less worrying, more drinking responsibly.
